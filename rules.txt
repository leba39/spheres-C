Write a program contained in sphere.c which does the following:

        - declare an array of 100 Spheres
        - Ask the user for the name of the data file
        - Open the data file
        - check to make sure the file opened successfully
        - if the file FAILED to open return to step 2
        - Skip the first two lines of the data file.
        - read the radius and color for an unknown number of Spheres, assume that there is one record per line.
        - you may assume there are fewer than 100 Spheres
        - store each Sphere in the array of Spheres
        - donâ€™t forget to close the data file 
    Once you have read all the data:
        Report the following:
        - Print a list of all Spheres reporting the color, radius, area, and volume
        - Total number of Spheres
        - Percentage of Spheres that are red
        - Total number of Spheres with volume greater than 215.
        - Average area of all Spheres 

All amounts should be rounded to two decimal points.
Here's the code for the Sphere struct to get you started:
____________________________

INTRO:

struct Sphere
{
  double radius;
  char *color;
};

//this function should change the radius of the sphere to whatever you tell it
void change_radius(struct Sphere *sphere, double new_radius);

//this function should change the color of the sphere to whatever you tell it
void change_color(struct Sphere *sphere, char *new_color);

//this function should get the area of the given sphere.
//the formula for area of a sphere is A = 4 * pi * (r ^ 2)
double calculate_area(struct Sphere sphere);

//this function should get the volume of the given sphere.
//the formula for volume of a sphere is V = (4 / 3) * pi * (r ^ 3)
double calculate_volume(struct Sphere sphere);

//this function should return true if the spheres have the same radius and color, false otherwise
//don't forget to #include <stdbool.h>
bool are_equal(struct Sphere one, struct Sphere two);
